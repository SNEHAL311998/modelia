**Manual Work:**
- Component interface design decisions
- User experience flow planning
- Custom styling adjustments
- Accessibility enhancements

**AI Usage Notes:**
> AI generated complete functional components with proper TypeScript typing, event handling, and styling. Manual refinement focused on UX improvements and accessibility compliance.

### 3. **🎨 UI/UX Design & Styling**
**AI Contribution:**
- TailwindCSS class combinations for layouts
- Responsive design patterns
- Dark mode implementation
- Color scheme and spacing decisions
- Animation and transition effects

**Manual Work:**
- Visual design requirements specification
